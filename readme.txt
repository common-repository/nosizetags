Tired from folded or stretched images you wanted to fit into your theme with max-width css tag? This plugin solves the problem.

== Description ==

Sometimes you need to use max-width settings in css to fit the layout. But what to do if the image stretchs or folds? The problem are the width and height attributes in image tags inserted by WordPress. This plugin deletes these attributes.

This plugin deletes the attribute "height" from the image tag. So it's very simple.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `no-size-tags.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. It's ready!

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
